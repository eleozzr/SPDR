# SPDR

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the article **Structure preserved dimension reduction using triplets for integration of single cell transcriptomics data** by Xu _et al._

SPDR is a novel **s**tructure **p**reserved **d**imension **r**eduction method using inter-batch triplets to simultaneously account for global structure,  remove batch effect and improve low-dimensional visualization of scRNA-seq data.

## Gettting started

See the jupyter notebook tutorial [SPDR_simulation1](./tutorial/SPDR_simulation1.ipynb) for a complete running example.

The code of generating the simulated data for Figure 2 is available at [simulation_data](./data/simulation_data.ipynb).
